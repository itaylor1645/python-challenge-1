Variety Food Truck Ordering System:
This Python script provides an interactive menu for a variety food truck, allowing customers to select items from different categories and place orders. Below is a breakdown of the script's functionality:

Menu Dictionary:
The script begins by defining a menu dictionary containing various food items categorized under "Snacks," "Meals," "Drinks," and "Dessert." Each category further contains specific items with their respective prices.

Order Processing:
Upon running the script, customers are greeted and prompted to select items from the menu.
The script loops through the menu categories, allowing customers to choose from available options.
Customers can select multiple items from each category and specify the quantity for each item.
After each selection, the script displays the chosen item, its price, and prompts for the quantity.
Once the customer finishes ordering from one category, they are asked if they wish to continue ordering or proceed to checkout.
If the customer decides to stop ordering, the script displays the final order summary including item names, prices, and quantities.
The total cost of the order is calculated and presented to the customer.

Know Issues:
-Spacing issues may occur in the menu items output and receipts if menu prices are increased beyond $99.99
